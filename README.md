*Second JavaScript Project*

In this project I'll be trying to create a movie seat booking UI with local storage.

- First part: Selecting seats, adding classes, updating DOM
- Second part: Adding local storage, when the page is refreshed it will keep the selected seats

I have to do this project with ReactJS at one point - would be better to have React components in the HTML because of the repetition
Setting up the Local Storage was difficult.
